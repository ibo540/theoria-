    "description": "Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine's independence created a strategic dilemma for Russia. Over decades, NATO expansion and Ukraine's drift toward the West escalated tensions, leading to the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and a full-scale invasion in 2022.",
    "fullDescription": "The Russo-Ukrainian War is an ongoing international conflict between Russia and Ukraine. It began in February 2014 following the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity, but its roots trace back to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia viewed Ukraine's independence and subsequent Western alignment as a strategic threat. The conflict escalated with the annexation of Crimea, the war in Donbas, and eventually the full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
